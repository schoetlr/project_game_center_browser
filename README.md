hiss hiss gulp grow hiss...

I  made this way harder than it should be the first time.  I was keeping track of the whole board, when I can just keep track of the snake coordinates, and food piece cooridinates.  I am going to submit a pull request of this first version, and then refactor in a seperate branch(Mainly just the model and my view.displayBoard)
